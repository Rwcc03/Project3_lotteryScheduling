# Project3_lotteryScheduling
# By Carter Lange and Will Copley


Carter and Will work: When we worked on this project, we always met up together to work on this. We both went through to set up the system calls by ourselves, so we both were on the same task when working together. Then after this, we met up and worked on it together during Office hours, and other times outside of office hours. We quite literally worked on all of this together in person.
